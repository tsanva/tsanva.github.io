      hi. my name is vasant.<br>
      i have written many iterations of this about page in many text editors but every one of them was stupid xdd.<br>
      i like to think that i dont define me. you define me.<br>
      search for my name on google, look at my social media, etc etc you know how to do it.
    </p>
    <h1>about this website</h1>
    <p>
      i just think it's cool to have <code>${YOUR_NAME}.${COOL_TLD}</code> xdd<br>
      bought the domain and decided to write a website to let people know that i own vasant.xyz 8)
    </p>
    <p>
      you might notice that this is a rather simple website.
      however i do have plans to make the website look nicer visually (while still maintaining high SNR). someday...
